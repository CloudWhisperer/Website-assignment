      <h4 id="TvShow"> <u> <p style="color: black; background-color: red"> My favourite TV show and why it's so good - Prison Break </p> </u> </h4>
      <p style="color: red;"> Prison break is one of a kind TV show and i've never seen anything like it before. The story consists of a younger brother intentionally putting himself into prison to break out his older brother. </p>
      <p style="color: red;"> The plot though is the fact that the younger brother is actually a structural engineer and he was the one who made the structural blueprints to that prison.</p>
      <p style="color: red;"> Before he puts himself into the prison he gets a full body tattoo that looks normal at first but is actually the prison blueprints if you look closely, this is to aid his escape.</p>
      <p style="color: red;"> The reasonm this TV show is so good is because the characters are so likable and his plan always takes a wrong turn and you always want to see what he does to put his plan back on track.</p>

    <div>
      <h4 id="Anime"> <u> <p style="color: black; background-color: red"> My favourite anime and why it's so good - My Hero Academia</p> </u> </h4>
      <p style="color: red;"> When i first heard about this i didnt think much of it, but after watching all the seasons twice i now know why its so good. </p>
      <p style="color: red;"> This anime is about a world where everyone has thier own personal powers called "quirks". People are born with these powers and they go to school where they can learn how to use them effectivly.</p>
      <p style="color: red;"> Expect for the main character who always wanted one but is born without one, he then meets his childhood hero and he obtains a the most powerful quirk, all for one,</p>
      <p style="color: red;"> All for one is a quick that allows him to use any part of his body at exceedingly high strength, and with this he then competes in exams against his classmates.</p>
      <p style="color: red;"> This anime is so good because something is always happening, keeping the viewer engaged at all times. And because of that this anime takes my favourite.</p>
